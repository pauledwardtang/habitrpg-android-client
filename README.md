# HabitRPG Android Client

## Movitation
Basic HabitRPG client for Android based off of jsmadja's habitrpg-java-client (https://github.com/jsmadja/habitrpg-java-client). Motivation for making this project was due to issues using the habitrpg-java-client (dexer errors when using the Jersey/Jackson APIs) when compiling for Android. I had to strip out all of the client code from the habitrpg-java-client and change a couple of the resource classes so they were compatible with GSON. 

## TODOs
- Implement POST/DELETE for Tasks
- Add AsyncTask wrappers
